# Flunkr - Changes Log

## May 13, 2026
- **NEW** VAST Fetch summary card blinks red when the fetch time exceeds 1 second
- **IMPROVED** Same blink-red treatment now applied to Avg Media TTFB and Slowest Resource cards (threshold: 1 second)

## May 12, 2026
- **NEW** Gear icon in the header now spins while the VAST unit is being fetched (initial fetch + wrapper chain) and stops once resolution completes
- **CHANGED** Gear spin tuned to 1.2s per rotation for a clear "loading" feel; idle by default, no longer spins continuously
- **NEW** Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — animation is suppressed for users who opt out of motion at the OS level

## May 11, 2026
- **NEW** Added gear icon to header title
- **NEW** Added BETA badge to header
- **NEW** Added Changes Log dialog and CHANGES.md file
- **REMOVED** Geo Map view from Tracking Domain Map — endpoint locations could not be reliably resolved (most ad-tech traffic terminates at CDN edges, making the markers misleading)
- **IMPROVED** Tracking Domain Map radial view — domain nodes are now donut charts whose arc segments show the per-domain event-type breakdown (3rd visual aspect alongside ring distance and node size); added curved category-colored links, glow-lit core, guide rings, and inline domain labels
